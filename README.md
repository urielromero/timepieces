# timepieces


This website is created to practice HTML, CSS and some JS learned from my first-website(see repository). 

I have a passion for watches and thought I would create a website with them as the main theme. This will represent a store's website where you can see different wacthes and their desciption, along with additional imagery that depicts their character. 

No database has been implemented yet, but i will try to add more to website as I learn.


I used Brackets as IDE and different websites to get non-copyrighted images and video clip.
